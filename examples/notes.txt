To compile the first example:

1. Open a new terminal (make sure its cmd, not bash or powershell)
2. Run this command:
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\18\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
    -- This opens a terminal that's in the proper environment for everything needed to compile
    -- UPDATE: this isnt needed anymore just have a cmd
3. Run the compilation command
    hipcc examples/01_vector_add.hip -o vector_add_example.exe
    -- My GPU is an RX 6600, so I use gfx1032, may be different for you just ask chat or something
4. Lastly just execute the created executable
    vector_add_example.exe
